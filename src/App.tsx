                  Thanks for the opportunity to interview for your company.
                  <br />I enjoy doing this type of thing, and unless you give me
                  a timebox I could just tinker forever.

                <strong>Weather Component</strong>
                <p>
                  Even though you said the weather component could be hard
                  coded, I've made it a little interactive.
                  <br />
                  The source is drawn from seed data, based on your image in the
                  pdf.
                  <br />
                  I've added a bit of validation and an opportinity for you to
                  play god and change the outlook for tomorrow.

                  There are also ways to tweak the route conditions in the

                <p>
                  Or change the delay here and the coloured dot will change in
                  the Delayed Routes Component.

                <strong>Ramp Chart</strong>
                <p>
                  I let the side down a bit on the only truly dynamic bit of the
                  test, and that is the Ramp Chart.
                  <br />
                  Yes, it draws information from the little api-ish bit you
                  supplied, but my machine was getting a bit of a race condition
                  and sometimes updating at "weird" intervals. So I put a
                  wrapper inside the update to ensure it had been at least 500ms
                  since the update. This was an effort to stop a super flashing
                  display.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Again, I could go at this for days but I went with a
                  google-charts pie chart, and struggled a bit with it to make
                  it look like yours.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If my lawn wasn't quite so long, and it wasn't Sunday I
                  probably would have had a look around for a more suitable
                  library, or in-fact done my own HTML5 canvas so I can set up
                  everything just the way I want it.
